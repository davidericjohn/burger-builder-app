This is a demo project I built using React and Redux while learning through an online course. 

The Burger Builder application allows you to customize your burger and process the order.
It is a simple application built mainly with the below libraries and Firebase as its backend. I also used Node Package Manager(NPM) to manage this project.

- react
- react-router-dom
- axios
- redux
- redux-saga
- react-redux

## What's Next?

### Features:

- Add form labels
- Auto populate form based on the user logged in

### Enhancements:

- Possibly create my own FormComponent that maintains its own state to encapsulate all form related actions such as building and validating the form or explore with the available third party libraries.
- More Documentation
- Unit Test
- Refactor functions for better reusability and flexibility
- Refactor the ingredients data model to include prices
- Enhance error handling
- Prop-types validation
